This will involve applying what you already know about neural nets and new NLP concepts of tokenization and vectorization.\n","\n","For this project, we will be working with the `fetch_20newsgroups` dataset, which is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. Each newsgroup covers a different topic, such as sports, politics, religion, and technology. The documents within each newsgroup were posted by various authors, and cover a wide range of subtopics related to the main theme of the newsgroup.\n","\n","The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify newsgroup documents based on their content.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Lab Structure**\n","**Part 1**: [Tokenization and
